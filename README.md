# Jd4Software.Xamarin.Utils
Having developed apps in Xamarin for clients for over 5 year, I have found that I keep repeating certain tasks over and over again.  I thought it was about time that I put these classes into a library and put it on nuget.org so I can access it easily in the future.  If others want to use this code then even better.

I will be adding to this project over time, but the initial version includes classes used for SQLite access.
